											<h2> Genius Hour </h2>
											<p>This year I worked on the genius hour project. Genius hour is basically 
											when each student can research any topic that interests them, they later have 
											to write a report on their topic and apply what they learned in their project.
											 I worked on this project in my STEM foundations class, so everything I worked 
											 on had to be put into a webpage. I think I grew the most during this project,
											 I learned how to apply my knowledge to a webpage and keep it looking professional.
											 Also I learned new things in CSS (Casscading Style Sheets) such as a dropdown navigation bar. Overall I enjoyed 
											 this project, it was stressful at times but in the end it was very rewarding.</p>

											 </div>
											 <p>These images show my codding progress ass I learned a little more about CSS and styling 
											 throughout the project. As you can see my coding slowly gets better and better, my favorite
											 page is the converse page because of the gradient background. I the first image something 
											 that really stands out it me is how I didn’t even have a proper navigation bar. I learned 
											 of this in one year so I am very proud of myself.</p>

											   <p> The board game project was a challenge for my group and me, during the project we lost our board and we couldn’t even decide on an idea for out game. Even though it was hard, some parts of the project where very rewarding. I had two great partners who put a lot of work into our final product.</P>

											<p> The plate tectonics project was my favorite throughout the whole year, I enjoyed building the mechanisms that would help our plates move and learning about the Andes mountain range. One major thing meet group succeeded in during this project was collaboration.</p>
