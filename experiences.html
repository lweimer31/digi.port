<h2> Classes and Clubs </h2>
<p>This page houses information about my STEM experiences, science fair,
and the school clubs I participate in. During my time at STEM, I have learned
some valuable skills that are not regularly taught in a typical high school.
Some of these skills include; learning CAD (computer aided design), operating
a 3D printer, designing files to be laser cut or vinyl printed, managing a vinyl
printer, and conducting a laser cutting operation. Also, I learned to code this
website! On this page, you can read about my growth in the previously mentioned
items and view pictures and artifacts to get a feel for what my STEM education
has been like. I have also written about some school clubs I enjoy and about my
previous science fair projects. </p>
<h2>CAD and 3D Printing</h2>
<p>Before you can 3D print an item, you must design or model it digitally; this is
called CAD. CAD stands for computer aided design, and it can be done on multiple
platforms. For all of my 3D printed projects, I used Autodesk Inventor. Below are
some pictures of what a CAD model looks like, compared to the final product. In
Freshman year, I designed a claw for my little sister, Ayami, to use opening her
Christmas presents. Ayami has Cerebral Palsy which affects how she functions in
day-to-day operations, it especially changes the way she uses her hands. The claw
I designed fits almost like brass knuckles, and has a shredding tool that covers
her palm to rip wrapping paper. </p>

<p>You can see in the model above, the special elements I included in the design
to make wearing the claw comfortable. The finger-holes have filleted, or smooth,
edges so her fingers wouldn’t get sore and I added divots into the palm piece to
make sliding her fingers into the tool easier. </p>
<h2>Designing For Laser Cutting and Vinyl Printing</h2>
<p>Before printing an item on the vinyl printer, you need to create a design to print.
I used Adobe Illustrator for this process. I have included a few pictures of the designs
I printed during school. Operating a vinyl printer is fairly similar to operating a regular
printer, but with a few extra steps. Vinyl printers usually have blades running through
them to cut the thick vinyl into strips. It is important to ensure these blades are running
smoothly, otherwise the operation is pretty simple. Below, I have included two designs I vinyl printed.</p>

<p>I created the templates for my laser cutting projects in Adobe Illustrator also. My
Freshman year, I built and modeled a bird house using CAD software, then created a laser
cutting template from the original model. Using a laser cutter, I cut out pieces of wood
to assemble into the house. This bird house was later donated to a local women’s shelter
in my area. I really hope the women who fled their situations found joy in my bird house.
Below are pictures of laser cutting template, and my final product. </p>

<h2>Coding for HTML</h2>
<p>By far, coding has definitely been the most enjoyable skill I’ve learned. I really enjoy
writing code, designing websites, and solving problems within my code. In fact, this entire
website has been a project I have built on since 8th grade, when I first started coding classes. </p>
<h2>Key Club</h2>
<p>Key club is an organization for those who wish to complete community service projects in the
local area and help with school events. I joined Key Club Freshman year, and I absolutely love
it. I have enjoyed meeting new people at volunteering events and participating as an active member
of my community. My most memorable volunteering experience has been serving victims of the Memorial
Day Tornadoes. In 2019, a total of 21 tornadoes were reported across the state from the evening of
May 27 into the early morning of May 28. Even months after the event, several communities had remained
destroyed. I was given the opportunity to serve food to those who’s homes had been destroyed, it was a
very touching experience. Hearing the stories of the people I met and interacting with them really
reminded me of my privilege. My family has had financial struggles, but I know if our house was destroyed
we would be taken care of. I truly learned the value of showing care and compassion to everyone I meet.</p>

<h2>Student Government</h2>
<p>In Student Government, I help plan school events and complete projects around the school. In Junior
year, I designed and completed a project for Earth Day. I created pamphlets with instructions on how to
create a recycled greenhouse with household materials. These pamphlets also included information about
Earth Day and fun facts about the environment. I distributed these pamphlets along with packets of different
flower seeds. It was super cool receiving pictures of people’s completed projects. My favorite part of
Student Government has definitely been pursuing projects I am passionate in. Below is a template of the
pamphlet I created!</p>

<h2>Student Ambassador</h2>
<p>As a student ambassador, I give tours of the building and talk to perspective families. I like being
an ambassador because I get to meet new people and show off the school that I love going to. Below is a
picture of my friends and I after a STEM info session Sophomore year. </p>

<h2>National Honor Socitey</h2>
<p>In National Honor Society, members complete service projects for the school and community. My most
recent project, was a food drive to help STEM families in need. Here I am holding my NHS certificate! </p>
