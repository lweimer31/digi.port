					<p> In the beginning of the school year I do not think I was much different except for the fact that I had no idea how much work high
					school was going to be. For me, school work comes pretty naturally, I have never struggled too much. Also, I like to work hard so the
					home work load was not too difficult for me. I just was not excepting the teachers to all give us homework almost every night, and on 
					the weekends. I think that during the course of the year I have changed as a student and a person. As a student, I have learned to manage
					my school work and home life, it was not too hard for me to find that balance. I do however believe it is harder for me to manage my
					stress this year because I am getting less sleep and everything I do in school now affects my GPA. I think I changes as a person too, 
					last year I was new in school so I was not always comfortable with people and my surroundings. This year, I know a lot of the kids at
					my school and I am not nervous around them. As a student, I am hardworking and persistent, I think that prepares me for 10th grade.</p>
					<p> To excel means to meet or exceed a goal. An example of excelling would be running a race, and beating your previous time for that race.
In the apocalyptic fiction project, students wrote a short story about how people would react to a natural disaster or the “apocalypse”.
This project took a really long time and I think that is why I excelled during it, I had time to revise my work over and over again.
We started this project in first quarter and ended in second. To begin the project, each student had to write a character vignette. A vignette just gives introduction to the character and explains their life, personality, or looks. I created a character named Bobbi. Then, we had to write several “diary entries” about our characters. This activity helped us explain how our character would react to a certain situation. Then, when it was time to begin writing the final story, we knew who our characters were and how they would react to events. The challenging part during this project was writing the final story it was hard for two main reasons. One, the story could only be 2000 words long, and two, because we had to revise over and over. I did not like having a word limit to my story because I found it difficult to only include certain details. I also did not like how much we had to revise our work because I liked my story the way it was. Sometimes, I find it hard to take people’s feedback because I am super opinionated. Even though some aspects of this project was hard, I found it rewarding in the end.

					<p>For me, a struggle is when someone had a difficult time completing their goal. This year one project I struggled with was the unreal project.
During this project students had to create a video game level that teaches the player about history. My game has three levels African American history,
women’s history, and the progressive era. Even though this project was a struggle for me I thought it was really fun, I most enjoyed creating
a museum to show all of the things I had learned. I consider this project a struggle because my computer and unreal engine, (which I designed
the video game on) was not working.  The program was glitching so, I lost a lot of my work. In the images below you can see screen shots of my
video game level. These just show that I was able to effectively design a game.
To begin this project, students watched several video tutorials and answered questions to prove what we know.  We watched these videos for about two weeks before the project began. Once the project had begun and my computer started to work again, the project was very fun. On the bottom, right image, you can see that I designed a museum. The lights on the wall turn on when the player walks into a room. This small element of the project took me the longest to complete because I had to program the way the lights worked. Overall, even though the software I used to design the project was very glitch-y and sometimes annoying, I thought it was very fun.

					<p>Growth is pretty simple, it just means to improve on the skills you previously had. For me, the mini design project was a growth
because I had terrible CAD skills. In the beginning of the year I found it hard to CAD a cube! Now it is much easier for me to
create new, more difficult, shapes. The goal of the mini design project was to find a need, and create something to help fulfill that need.
I choose to create a “claw” to help my little sister with cerebral pulsey open her Christmas presents. In the image on the bottom, right you
can see the design I created in Autodesk Inventor. My little sister’s fingers co through the holes and the base of the claw rests on her palm
spiked-side-out. The second image is the printed claw. We began this project by learning how to use the 3d-printer. Students learned how to change filament in a printer, remove the print bed, and remove a printed project off of the print bed. This process took about two days. Then, my classmates and I had about three days to decide on what project to design. At first, I wanted to create a phone holder but in the end I decided to make something more meaningful. I thought a claw to help my little sister would be the perfect Christmas gift. I thoroughly enjoyed this project. Unlike other projects I had done before, this one was much more meaningful to me. It also gave students the creativity to make something interesting to them.

				    <p>This year as a student I am pretty similar to the girl I was in August except for one thing, I always want to do the best work I can.
I know that for me to achieve the goals I have set for myself in life I need to always work hard. One thing that is really important to
me are my grades and I know that I can’t get exceptional grades without being an exceptional student. I am ready for tenth grade because
I am ready to work hard, I relayed on inquiry and persistence this year and I will most likely rely on those qualities next year.
In tenth grade I hope to keep my grades up and keep a 4.00 GPA.
This year has been super fun. I have learned a lot during my classes, but I think I have also learned how to be a more diligent student, a better friend, and how to keep my head up when the going gets tough. All of the projects I have completed this year have taught me how to push myself so I can produce the best product. It is always good to be proud of what you create and this year, I am proud of all my accomplishments.
