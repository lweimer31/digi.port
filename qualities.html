	<h2>  5 Qualities </h2>
	<p>At DRSS there are five main qualities students and teachers are encouraged to act on, those qualities are as follows; creativity, collaboration, communication, persistence, and inquiry. To me, persistence is the most important quality because it means always striving to achieve your goals, even when things are hard.  Students must learn to use every quality listed to be successful at DRSS, they are defined here, below. </p>
		
	<h2> Creativity </h2>
	<p>Creativity is the use of the imagination or original ideas, especially in the production of an art. However, creativity is important in the real-world, not just art. People must be creative in finding solutions to modern problems. </p>

	<h2> Collaboration </h2>
	<p> Collaboration means working together with other people to create or produce something. Collaboration is essential because large problems are solved best when different peole from all types of backgrounds an learn to work together. </p>

	<h2> Communication </h2>
	<p>Communication is the act of exchanging information, communication can come in many forms such as; e-mail, text, call, or face-to-face conversations </p>

	<h2> Persistence </h2>
	<p>Persistence is not only a life skill, but also a personality trait, people who are persistent try their hardest never to give up even in tough times. When people are persistent, amazing things can happen.</p>

	<h2> Inquiry </h2>
	<p>Inquiry is the act of investigating or asking new questions, it is important to have inquiry to make new discoveries. Without inquiry society couldnâ€™t advance any further.  </p>
