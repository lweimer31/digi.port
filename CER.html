		<p>The purpose of this report was to examine and research two prospective careers and possible internships. 
		The two occupations chosen to research were political scientist and lawyer. The method to complete this report 
		included selecting two careers to explore, establishing essential questions, locating resources, and researching 
		potential internship options. Many sources were selected for this report: The Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™, Learn To 
		Become, The New Yorker, ABA Law Practice Today, The College Board, the UN Refugee Agency, and CNN. The answers to the 
		essential questions included information about salary, job growth, international opportunities, colleges with the 
		necessary programs, who this occupation works alongside, and the qualities needed to be successful in this career. 
		Once these questions were answered, personal information regarding both careers and rational for selecting these 
		careers were given. Last, potential internships were located along with information concerning what types of 
		internship environments would be beneficial to joining the workforce. At the end of this report it was determined
		the career that would be the most beneficial and practical would be political science. </p>
