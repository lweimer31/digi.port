<h2>What is PBL?</h2>
<p> At DRSS the curriculum relies heavily on PBL which stands for Project Based Learning. Project Based Learning is a method where students gain knowledge and skills by working for a period of time to investigate a question, problem, or challenge. Throughout the year we have done many projects to help us better understand our knowledge for the subjects we are taught, for example during the plate tectonics unit we made models to demonstrate how the earth moved. I think PBL is important because some students benefit from physically touching or discovering what they are learning about.</p>
<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
					<p>Problem solving is a skill I improved in at DRSS. When I analyze a problem I begin by making a list of the steps I need 
					to solve the problem in. It is important to have reasoning for your decisions so when you analyze a problem you can support your 
					evidence. When I solve a problem at first I feel stressed then, once I begin to organize the problem and itâ€™s steps, I feel much 
					calmer. For me, patience plays a big role in problem solving, the main reason it does, is because I like to take my time. I do not
					like to feel rushed by other people. In my opinion summarizing the results of a problem is much harder than solving the problem 
					itself. This is mostly because I am afraid I will have a hard time explaining my ideas and thought process to other people. I like 
					to keep my work to myself, probably because I am an introverted person. There are several methods to solving a problem.
					Depending on the type of person you are, certain aspects on problem solving will be easier for different people. </p>
