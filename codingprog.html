										<h2> 8th Grade Coding Progress </h2>
									
									<p>Because I was not here in seventh grade everything I know about coding I learned this 
									year, this year it has been hard to keep up with coding I think I have learned a lot. First
									of all, I learned what HTML and CSS are. HTML stands for hypertext mark-up language and it
									is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. To make web
									Pages visually appealing you can use CSS, CSS stands for cascading style sheets. 
									In a style sheet you can create backgrounds, borders, and much more. This year I
									learned how to create a border, a background, a navigation bar, and dropdowns. Most 
									of these things I styles in a style sheet. Also I learned what a div element is. For
									me this is the most important thing I have learned all year. A div is the generic 
									container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled 
									using CSS.  Itâ€™s used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class 
									or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being different than everything 
									else. I feel I have really grown in codding this year and I am excited to learn more next year!</p>

									</div>
								
									<p>In the pictures above you can see I learned a few things I coding. I learned how to add pictures
									and videos. Also, I can now change the colors of elements. While all of these things have to do with
									CSS I also learned new things in HTML. I learned how to make ordered lists, unordered lists, headers,
									banners, and footers.</p>
									
									<h2> 9th Grade Coding Progress </h2> 
									<p> This year we did not have a class to learn coding in. that is why there is not drastic improvement
									on my more coding abilities. The image below on the right is my website from last year, I think this year my work looks more professional. </p>

									<h2> 10th Grade Coding Progress </h2> 
									<p> This year there was not an official class for coding so my portfolio is similar to last year's. I really liked my coding from 9th grade so I 
										hardly changed my website's look. I only changed the color scheme.	</p>
