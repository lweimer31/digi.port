							<h2> The Instructions Project </h2>
							
							<div id="sidebar1100">
							<img src="pagephotos/11page1.png" alt="Instructions Project." width="300" height="390"> 
							</div>
							<p>During the instructions project, I was partnered with a classmate to write instructions that a 6th grader could easily follow. Our main goal of the project was to communicate a lab we completed in Chemistry class in a way that 6th graders could understand. While completing this project I learned how to write instructions, complete a usability test, and calibrate an oven. Most importantly, I learned new ways to communicate with my partner. This was the first project that we completed while learning virtually. In the past, I would’ve been able to walk up to my partner and ask them questions or make a project plan with them, instead we communicated through Zoom, e-mail, and text. Learning new methods to communicate with someone I already knew was hard, but when we completed usability testing with 6th grade strangers it was even harder. We spoke to the 6th graders through zoom and they gave us feedback in a Word-document. Overall, this was a really fun project. I learned new professional writing skills and new methods of communication.  </p>

							<h2> Blind Contour Art Peice </h2>

							</div>
							<p> Blind contour drawing is when you trace an object without looking at your drawing hand or paper. Usually in Art class when we practice blind contour drawing, we draw each other in person. This year, an exercise I already thought was challenging was made even more difficult when we had to pose and draw each other over Zoom. Drawing my classmates through Zoom was challenging for several reasons; it was hard to capture dimension and posing for the drawing felt awkward. Humans don’t only communicate through words, but also emotion. Emotion plays such a big part in art and capturing emotion through a computer screen was very difficult. If I had completed this project in person, it would have been much easier to capture emotion and decipher how the classmates I drew felt. In the end, this project gave me some insight into reading peoples emotions better from afar.</p>

							<h2> The Anarchist Checkbook Project </h2>							
							
							<div id="sidebar11000">
							<img src="pagephotos/11page4.png" alt="Anarchist Checkbook." width="300" height="390"> 
							</div>
							<p>The anarchist checkbook project was a group project where we were divided into four different groups per class. My group and I were tasked with writing a book explaining four different economic principles: traditional, market, command, and mixed economies. in our checkbook we wrote about the pros and cons of each system, the basic principles of each system, historical examples, and our predictions of how these systems would change. After, we had to create a house plan describing our ideal economic system. This project was very challenging because of hybrid learning. Some days we were in-person and others we were on Zoom. There were also some students who opted out of hybrid learning and remained fully virtual. Because I was assigned the role of house manager, a lot of the communication responsibilities fell on me. There were times when some group members just didn’t complete their work or didn’t know what they had to complete. In the end, I completed about 75 percent of the project by myself, but I learned that its important to be direct when working in a team.  </p>

							<h2> Science Fair </h2>
							
							<div id="sidebar11">

							</div>
							<p> I've done science fair since my freshman year of high school, and this year was the first time that I didn't have a science fair advisor. In freshman and sophomore year I took honors science classes and had an advisory dedicated to science fair. This year, completing the project was difficult because there aren't any science fair advisors for upperclassmen. Science fair is something I'm really passionate about and I'm always super excited to present my final project. Usually, when we present our final projects, we make a trifle and meet with multiple science fair judges. This year, I made a PowerPoint and a video to communicate with the judges. Creating the video is really challenging for me because I only had 10 minutes to communicate everything that I had done in the past year. I learned how visual aids can enhance a video to better communicate one's meeting. My final video was a combination of PowerPoint and recording that took a long time to make. The process was definitely worth it though, because I made it to state science day. </p>
