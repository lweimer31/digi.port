			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>I have participated in science fair competitions since my freshman year of high school. Each of my projects has been a continuation of the last, centralized around engineering hydroponic systems. A hydroponic system grows plants without soil. The seeds are planted in a growth media suspended over a tank of water. Then, as the plant matures, it is sustained by nutrients found in the water tank. freshman year, I created a recycled growth media, sophomore year I made a recycled hydroponics system, and junior year I engineered a hydroponic system that filters water and grows plants. There are three local levels to these contests; school, district, and state. My freshman and junior year, I earned a “Superior” score in the State Science Day competition, and a “Superior” score in the district level my sophomore year. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, the State Science Day was cancelled that year. </p>
				<p>Because competing in science fairs has been such a huge part of my high school career, I decided to create another page summarizing these projects. Below, you can read my abstracts from each project (which have definitely improved since freshman year), view pictures of each hydroponic system, and see some of the awards I have won. My final research papers will also be linked in this page, if you would like to learn more about hydroponics itself. </p>
		
			<h2>Freshman Year</h2>
				<p>Abstract: This project is about hydroponics. Hydroponics is a very important way of growing plants, and can help people acquire fresh produce when the land is not fit for growing. I like the idea of being able to help people in need, which is why I chose this topic. “I can develop a suitable growth media from plants out of recycled materials found in the classroom.” Was the project hypothesis. To prove this hypothesis, I performed three, ten-day growth cycles of commonly used growth media; vermiculite, water beads, peat moss, and gro-block. I placed these medias into 3D printed pods that would suspend the media and seeds into water mixed with a growth solution. I printed 100 pods, and each media had 25 pods per growth cycle. I grew plants in these commonly used medias so that I could compare the successfulness of these medias to the media I created. The amount of plants that sprouted determined the successfulness. After the three growth cycles, I conducted another cycle that had 75 pods containing the growth media we created, which consisted of shredded paper, pencil shavings, used brown paper towels, and cardboard from shipping boxes and tissue boxes. At the end of the experiment, my own growth media had 77% plants grow, and the other medias had around 80% grow overall, which proved that my hypothesis was correct. I learned that to make my own growth media, and that it can be sustainable in growing plants.</p>

				<p>This project was really cool because I had a lot of fun completing it, but also because I used 3D printing and laser cutting to finish it. I have included some pictures of a 3D modelled growth vessel and the grid that held all the plants. All of the colored baskets in the images above were designed and printed by me! </p>
				<p>I advanced to the State Science Day with this project and won some awards and prizes. I even won a mini scholarship to take classes at Stone Laboratory, a research lab in Lake Eerie. The images below show congressional recognition I recieved for my project. </p>

			<h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
				<p>Abstract: In today’s World, the irresponsible practices of humans poses an enormous threat to earth’s ecosystem; and ultimately, life for all creatures. Because of human’s voracious expansion further out to the earth, farmers are running out of suitable land for growing food. Not only this, but pollution caused by household waste also causes a major problem for the environment. My problem statement is as follows; families are uneducated about the ways they can reuse their old items in a manner that is helpful to them and the environment. As a solution I engineered a hydroponics system using only recycled household materials. The system created was by testing many different types of household materials from sponges to milk cartons. Different materials were tested during growth cycles of plants in which soybeans were grown in each different environment. At the end of each growth cycle, I took measurements of each plants height and made observations about the root structure. At the end of the project, I found that a simple, versatile, and inexpensive hydroponics systems can be created using common household items. This project can help reduce waste created by humans and educate families about effective ways to recycle and grow plants.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, because of the pandemic the State Science Day was cancelled, so I only competed at the school and district level. To continue this project further, I used what I had learned to create pamphlets and infographics for Earth Day. Now, at my school we save our recycles to grow plants. </p>

			<h2>Junior Year</h2>
				<p>Abstract: In 2018, it was estimated that 821 million people in the world were undernourished and according to the UN, only one in every three people has access to safe drinking water. This is a major issue and it can be attributed mainly to poor agricultural practices. 92 percent of the World’s freshwater is used for farming food and raising livestock and it is estimated that around 50 percent of that water is wasted due to evaporation and runoff caused by overwatering. This poses a question; How can we improve agricultural practices? This is a loaded question because there are so many different possibilities, but what if we could grow food and filter water at the same time? My problem statement is as follows; Due to poor agricultural practices many people are suffering from food and water scarcity. I think a solution to this problem lies in hydroponics and natural water purifiers. During the course of this project, I created and developed a system that grows plants and filters river water all in one 6-gallon. Different methods of filtering water were tested during growth cycles each amounting to seven days. At the beginning and end of each cycle, the water quality of river water was measured as well as measurements of each plant’s height. From trial and error, a system that efficiently filters river water while growing a sustainable food source was created. This project has the potential to help families who face food insecurity and countries with poor agriculture practices.</p>

				<p>Junior year, all science fair competitions were virtual. Above, is my virtual presentation, and below are some pictures of the awards I won. The left most image shows a congratulatory letter from the American Water Works Association, and the next two images are my certificates from earning a superior score at the district and state level.  </p>
