				<h2> Introduction </h2>
			</div>
			
			<p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Letty Weimer and I am a graduating senior at the Dayton Regional STEM School. I enrolled at DRSS in eighth grade and since, have enjoyed the education I received. My favorite subjects have been Anatomy and Physiology, Economics, and Current World Issues. Next year, I will attend Colorado Christian University to get my Bachelor of Science in Nursing. My goal is to become a travelling nurse and offer humanitarian aid abroad.  </p>
			<p>This website displays my projects and accomplishments since middle school. I currently participate in many school clubs and activities, which you can read about on my “Experiences” page. </p> </br>

				<h2> About Me </h2>
			</div>
			
			<p>I am a military kid, so I have moved around a lot; I’ve lived in Florida, England, Japan, and now Ohio. Because of my unique experience growing up, I am always looking for my next adventure. I come from a family of eight; my parents, my two brothers, three sisters, and me. I go to school with two of my siblings, and I even have a class with my little sister, which is pretty cool. Outside of school, I like to read, hike, and collect plants. I also am on the worship team for my youth group which is super fun! Below, is a picture of the worship team from last year, and a picture of my sister and I during our school’s pep rally. </p>
